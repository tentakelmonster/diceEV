# diceEV
Simple small tool to calculate EV's of different dice combinations

Run the exe or py, then enter your desired dice combination in the upper entry field.

This supports any canonical python methods, as well as advantage /adv()/ and disadvantage /disadv() or dis()/ in the style of DnD.

Example entries include '1d100', 'adv(4d8)', 'dis(1d10) + adv(1d4)', max(1d10, 2d5)'. Note that you always have to specify a number AND denomination of dice ('1d4', not 'd4').
